Greetings, hackers of [YOUR SCHOOL NAME HERE]!

Tomorrow (Thursday), Hack Club will storm the COVID-19 Global Hackathon (see Mark Zuckerberg’s post on it), a worldwide event hosted by many of the biggest names in tech: Facebook, TikTok, Giphy, Microsoft, Pinterest, Slack, Twitter, and WeChat.

The event starts Thursday 9 AM Pacific (Noon Eastern) and ends Monday 6:30 AM Pacific (12:30 Eastern). Thousands of professional engineers from major companies will participate. You may join their teams, form your own, or go it alone if that's your style.

To these big companies, Hack Club will be an underdog. Our plan is to storm the event with an armada of teenagers; hundreds of Hack Clubbers pitching in as the only teenage participants in an epic battle against COVID-19. We will show this virus—and the corporate machine—what we’re made of: grit, passion, and creativity.

ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS ARE WELCOME.
