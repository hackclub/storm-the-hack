To these big companies, Hack Club will be an underdog. Our plan is to storm the event with an armada of teenagers; hundreds of Hack Clubbers pitching in as the only teenage participants in an epic battle against COVID-19. We will show this virus—and the corporate machine—what we’re made of: grit, passion, and creativity.

Identify yourself as a Hack Clubber by suiting up with a badged Slack Avatar.
