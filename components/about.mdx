There is talk about a new hackathon on the block comrads. Over 2000 "enemy" soldiers have convened in the hackathon they call "COVID-2019 Global Hackathon"

Hack Club is taking over their sovereign soil but we need your help. We need to show the enemy soldiers what make a hacker a hacker. School is out, which means the gloves are off an now is the time to show the world what Hack Club is capable of. Gather your forces, build alliances, but most importantly, HACK! It's time, COVID-19 can't stop us all.
