We'll be joining a hackathon with thousands of participants across tens of companies and countries. To these big groups, Hack Club will be an underdog.

Our plan is to storm the event with an armada of teenagers; hundreds of Hack Clubbers pitching in as the only teenage participants in an epic battle against COVID-19. We will show this virus—and the corporate machine—what we’re made of: grit, passion, and creativity.

To represent Hack Club, suit up your Slack Avatar with a distinct HC Badge.
